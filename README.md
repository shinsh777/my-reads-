# project description

In the MyReads project, I developed a book shelf application that allows users to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or would like to read in the future. To build the application, I used React and provided an API server and client library that I used to persist information as users interacted with it.

It supports three shelves:
Currently Reading.
Want to Read.
Read.
you can search for books and add them to any shelf.

# download and run the project

- Clone or download the project
- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- to launch the project run . `npm start`

## Backend Server

Udacity provided the backend server against which the web application was developed.BooksAPI.js provides the methods that I used to perform the backend operations:

getAll
update
search

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/cra-template/template/README.md).
